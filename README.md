# NLP - Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python
In Machine Learning, Sentiment analysis refers to the application of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text analysis to identify and classify subjective opinions in source documents. Sentiment analysis aims to determine a writer’s attitude towards a topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude can be his judgment or assessment, his emotional state or the intended emotional communication. In sentiment analysis, the main task is to identify opinion words, which is very important. Opinion words are dominant indicators of feelings, especially adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, for example: “I love this camera. It’s amazing!”

Opinion words are also known as polarity words, sentiment words, opinion lexicon, or opinion words, which can generally be divided into two types: positive words, for example, wonderful. , elegant, astonishing; and negative words, eg horrible, disgusting, poor.
